h1. Perl 5 Cucumber

This is a minimal implementation of Cucumber in Perl5

To learn about Cucumber take a look at:
<a href="http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/">http://wiki.gihub.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber</a>

In a nutshell, it enables to run an external DSL called Gherkin to automate acceptance testing.
And the DSL looks like this:
<pre>
Feature:
  As a [role]
  I want to [operation]
  So that [business value]

  Scenario:
    Given [known state]
    And [more state]
    When I [action]
    And [more actions]
    Then [expected outcome]
    And [more outcomes]
</pre>

h2. Example:

h3. Story

<pre>
Feature: Dealing with mushrooms
  In order to test the effect of evil poisonous mushrooms
  As an evil scientist
  I want to test effects of eating mushrooms on little children

  Scenario: Mushrooms are bad for you, they kill boys
    Given a live boy in a forest
    When he ate a mushroom
    Then he was a dead boy in a forest

  Scenario: Mushrooms are bad for girls too
    Given a live girl in a forest
    When she ate a mushroom
    Then she was a dead girl in a forest
</pre>

h3. Code

<pre>
<code>
Given qr/(.*) in (.*)/, sub {
  my ($description,$location) = @_;
  $state{human} = $description;
  $state{location} = $location;
};

When qr/s?he ate (.*)/, sub {
  my $item = shift;
  if ($item eq 'a mushroom') {
    $state{human} =~ s/live/dead/;
  }
};

Then qr/s?he was (.*) in (.*)/, sub {
  my ($description,$location) = @_;
  is($state{human},$description,$description);
  is($state{location},$location,$location);
};
</code>
</pre>

h3. Execution output

<pre>
$ perl p5-cucumber.pl
Feature: Dealing with mushrooms
  In order to test the effect of evil poisonous mushrooms
  As an evil scientist
  I want to test effects of eating mushrooms on little children

  Scenario: Mushrooms are bad for you, they kill boys
    Given a live boy in a forest
    When he ate a mushroom
    Then he was a dead boy in a forest
ok 1 - a dead boy
ok 2 - a forest

  Scenario: Mushrooms are bad for girls too
    Given a live girl in a forest
    When she ate a mushroom
    Then she was a dead girl in the sea
ok 3 - a dead girl
not ok 4 - the sea
#   Failed test 'the sea'
#   at ./p5-cucumber.pl line 82.
#          got: 'a forest'
#     expected: 'the sea'
1..4
# Looks like you failed 1 test of 4.
</pre>
(exitcode is 1 for failure)

<p>And when we fix the story:</p>

<pre>
$ perl p5-cucumber.pl
Feature: Dealing with mushrooms
  In order to test the effect of evil poisonous mushrooms
  As an evil scientist
  I want to test effects of eating mushrooms on little children

  Scenario: Mushrooms are bad for you, they kill boys
    Given a live boy in a forest
    When he ate a mushroom
    Then he was a dead boy in a forest
ok 1 - a dead boy
ok 2 - a forest

  Scenario: Mushrooms are bad for girls too
    Given a live girl in a forest
    When she ate a mushroom
    Then she was a dead girl in a forest
ok 3 - a dead girl
ok 4 - a forest
1..4
</pre>
(exitcode is 0 for success)

h3. A story for this project

<pre>
Feature: Automating acceptance tests
  As a software quality insurance person
  I want to automate acceptance testing
  So that I free my time to do other things

  Scenario: Using cucumber to automate acceptance tests
    Given a story written in gherkin
    And steps written for it in perl
    When I use the cucumber module
    And give it my gherkin stories
    And give it my perl steps
    Then the stories are executed
    And I can see the result
</pre>

h3. Thanks

<p>
Great thank you for the perl-il and perl-qa mailing lists
for helping me with some high level perl concepts that make
this code so beautiful like it is.
</p>
<p>
Another huge thank you to the people in #perl @freenode.net
who helped me with sticky dereferencing and scalar/list
problems.
</p>
