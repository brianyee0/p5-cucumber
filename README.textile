h1. Perl 5 Cucumber

This is a minimal implementation of Cucumber in Perl5

To learn about Cucumber take a look at:
<a href="http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/">http://wiki.gihub.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber</a>


h2. Example:

h3. Story

<pre>
Feature: Dealing with mushrooms
  In order to know the effect of evil poisonous mushrooms
  We will test the effects of eating mushrooms on little children

  Scenario: Mushrooms are bad for you, they kill boys
    Given a live boy in a forest
    When he ate a mushroom
    Then he was a dead boy in a forest

  Scenario: Mushrooms are bad for girls too
    Given a live girl in a forest
    When she ate a mushroom
    Then she was a dead girl in a forest
</pre>

h3. Code

<pre>
<code>
Given qr/(.*) in (.*)/, sub {
  my ($description,$location) = @_;
  $state{human} = $description;
  $state{location} = $location;
};

When qr/s?he ate (.*)/, sub {
  my $item = shift;
  if ($item eq 'a mushroom') {
    $state{human} =~ s/live/dead/;
  }
};

Then qr/s?he was (.*) in (.*)/, sub {
  my ($description,$location) = @_;
  is($state{human},$description,$description);
  is($state{location},$location,$location);
};
</code>
</pre>

h3. Execution output

<pre>
$ perl p5-cucumber.pl
Feature: Dealing with mushrooms
  In order to know the effect of evil poisonous mushrooms
  We will test the effects of eating mushrooms on little children

  Scenario: Mushrooms are bad for you, they kill boys
    Given a live boy in a forest
    When he ate a mushroom
    Then he was a dead boy in a forest
ok 1 - a dead boy
ok 2 - a forest

  Scenario: Mushrooms are bad for girls too
    Given a live girl in a forest
    When she ate a mushroom
    Then she was a dead girl in the sea
ok 3 - a dead girl
not ok 4 - the sea
#   Failed test 'the sea'
#   at ./p5-cucumber.pl line 82.
#          got: 'a forest'
#     expected: 'the sea'
1..4
# Looks like you failed 1 test of 4.
</pre>
(exitcode is 1 for failure)

<p>And when we fix the story:</p>

<pre>
$ perl p5-cucumber.pl
Feature: Dealing with mushrooms
  In order to know the effect of evil poisonous mushrooms
  We will test the effects of eating mushrooms on little children

  Scenario: Mushrooms are bad for you, they kill boys
    Given a live boy in a forest
    When he ate a mushroom
    Then he was a dead boy in a forest
ok 1 - a dead boy
ok 2 - a forest

  Scenario: Mushrooms are bad for girls too
    Given a live girl in a forest
    When she ate a mushroom
    Then she was a dead girl in a forest
ok 3 - a dead girl
ok 4 - a forest
1..4
</pre>
(exitcode is 0 for success)

h3. Thanks

<p>
Great thank you for the perl-il and perl-qa mailing lists
for helping me with some high level perl concepts that make
this code so beautiful like it is.
