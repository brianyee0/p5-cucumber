This is a minimal implementation of Cucumber in Perl5

To learn about Cucumber take a look at http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/


Example of Perl5 usage:

= Story
Feature: Dealing with mushrooms
  In order to know the effect of evil poisonous mushrooms
  We will test the effects of eating mushrooms on little children

  Scenario: Mushrooms are bad for you, they kill boys
    Given a live boy
    When he ate a mushroom
    Then he was a dead boy

  Scenario: Mushrooms are bad for girls too
    Given a live girl
    When she ate a mushroom
    Then she was a dead girl

= Code
sm('Given a (.*)',sub {
  my @params = shift;
  $state{human} = $params[0];
});
sm('When s?he ate a mushroom',sub {
  $state{human} =~ s/live/dead/;
});
sm('Then s?he was a (.*)',sub {
  my @params = shift;
  is($state{human},$params[0]);
});
