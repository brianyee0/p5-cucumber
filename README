This is a minimal implementation of Cucumber in Perl5

To learn about Cucumber take a look at http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/


Example of Perl5 usage:

= Story

Feature: Dealing with mushrooms
  In order to know the effect of evil poisonous mushrooms
  We will test the effects of eating mushrooms on little children

  Scenario: Mushrooms are bad for you, they kill boys
    Given a live boy in a forest
    When he ate a mushroom
    Then he was a dead boy in a forest

  Scenario: Mushrooms are bad for girls too
    Given a live girl in a forest
    When she ate a mushroom
    Then she was a dead girl in a forest


= Code

Given qr/a (.*) in a (.*)/, sub {
  my ($description,$location) = @_;
  $state{human} = $description;
  $state{location} = $location;
};

When qr/s?he ate a mushroom/, sub {
  $state{human} =~ s/live/dead/;
};

Then qr/s?he was a (.*) in a (.*)/, sub {
  my ($description,$location) = @_;
  is($state{human},$description,$description);
  is($state{location},$location,$location);
};


= Thanks

Great thank you for the perl-il and perl-qa mailing lists
for helping me with some high level perl concepts that make
this code too so beautiful like it is.
