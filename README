This is a minimal implementation of Cucumber in Perl5

To learn about Cucumber take a look at http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/


Example of Perl5 usage:

= Story
Feature: Dealing with mushrooms
  In order to know the effect of evil poisonous mushrooms
  We will test the effects of eating mushrooms on little children

  Scenario: Mushrooms are bad for you, they kill boys
    Given a live boy in a forest
    When he ate a mushroom
    Then he was a dead boy in a forest

  Scenario: Mushrooms are bad for girls too
    Given a live girl in a forest
    When she ate a mushroom
    Then she was a dead girl in a forest

= Code

sm {
  my ($description,$location) = @_;
  $state{human} = $description;
  $state{location} = $location;
} qr/Given a (.*) in a (.*)/;

sm {
  $state{human} =~ s/live/dead/;
} qr/When s?he ate a mushroom/;

sm {
  my ($description,$location) = @_;
  is($state{human},$description,$description);
  is($state{location},$location,$location);
} qr/Then s?he was a (.*) in a (.*)/;
